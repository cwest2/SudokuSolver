MAJOR TODOS:
 - Increase parameterization overall
 - Introduce variables, to allow for more flexible creation besides coded variants
 - Add more of the major variants

IMMEDIATE TODOS:
 - Test 6x6 for all variants
 - Write functions for all variants

OPEN QUESTIONS:
 - Should variants have an "END VARIANT" portion in their .txt form
   ("END THERMO" for THERMO) in order to allow for optional arguments
   (like SLOW for THERMO)
   - Could maybe figure out how to do it without this, but this would make
     things easier
   - Would require rewriting existing files
     - Shouldn't be too hard though

VARIABILITY:
 - Need an existing model to create IntVars.  Currently, the only place models are created is in the LatinSquare.
 - How to get around this?
   - Could make the model outside of the Latin Square, use it to create IntVars outside of the puzzle structure
     - Pros: Means we can pass direct IntVars instead of some alternate structure, keep things simple
     - Cons: Means we need to make a model outside and pass in, requires serious restructuring
   - Could create an alternate structure to represent variables:
     - Pros: Means we can represent complex structures (like "each cage equals either M or N")
     - Cons: Complex, makes passing ints more difficult
       - This could be circumvented in the Builder
